# README - Full Data Science Project with FastAPI

## Objective
This project aims to build an end-to-end data science pipeline, integrating data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using FastAPI. The goal is to provide a structured and automated workflow for data-driven decision-making.

## Key Activities
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**
   - Load and clean raw datasets.
   - Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent formats.
   - Transform data into a suitable structure for modeling.

2. **Feature Engineering & Model Training:**
   - Generate meaningful features from raw data.
   - Train machine learning models for prediction or classification.
   - Evaluate model performance using key metrics.

3. **Model Deployment with FastAPI:**
   - Develop RESTful APIs to expose the trained model.
   - Implement request handling and inference logic.
   - Deploy the API for real-time predictions.

4. **Testing & Optimization:**
   - Test the API with sample requests.
   - Optimize model performance and API response time.
   - Implement logging and monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- FastAPI (Model Deployment)
- Uvicorn (API Server)
- Jupyter Notebooks (Exploratory Analysis)

## Key Insights
- Automating the data pipeline improves efficiency and reproducibility.
- Feature engineering significantly impacts model accuracy.
- FastAPI enables seamless and efficient model deployment.
- Proper testing and monitoring ensure reliable API performance.

## Running the Pipeline
### Prerequisites:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy scikit-learn
```
### Starting the FastAPI Server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Output
- A fully functional API for making predictions.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data ready for analysis.
- Trained machine learning models with performance reports.
